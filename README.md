# fullstackopenBackend
Currently perfecting my understanding of fullstack javascript using a university of Helsinki fullstack curriculum.This has been a great experience for me have learnt in-depth about 
testing using jest, cypress understood authentication with jsonwebtoken, asynchronous javascript, middleware, working with different user in database such as mongodb, 
strict error handling, continuous integration and deployment using github and heroku....more to come,this is the most interesting fullstack tutorial i have been exposed to it gives you strict 
exercises to work on while rigorously improving your skills.I was okay before but now i feel proficient enough to contribute my knowledge to the software and expect an exciting journey 
ahead
